This week, I continued working on the remote controller for the fog screen machine. My lab partners and I designed a case to house the Arduino board and the relay module. We used a 3D printer to build the case. We also designed a circuit board to connect the Arduino board to the relay module and some LEDs. I had to 3D print five prototypes of the case before we got the right dimensions. Afterwards, I soldered the DMX cable to the relay module and the Arduino board. I also edited the C++ and Arduino program to fix a connection problem. I also wrote a section of our research paper on the case design and the circuit board. 
I attended the UR2PHD summer class. This week, we discussed the importance of research and how to write a research paper. I also started working on my research paper for the class. I meet with my advisor on Friday to discuss the progress of my research paper.
