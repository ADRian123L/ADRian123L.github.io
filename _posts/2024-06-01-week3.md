title: Week 3

On week three I started by completing the code for the fog screen machine's controller. I made a class for serial communication between the Fetch robot and the Arduino board. I tested the code and it worked as expected. 
I worked on the introduction section of the research paper with my lab partners. We are now going to improve it.
