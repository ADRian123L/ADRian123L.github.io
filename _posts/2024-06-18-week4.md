title: Week 4

This week I continued working on the introduction section of the research paper with my lab partner. We are now going to improve it. I also worked on the code for the fog screen machine's controller. I tested that the code worked as expected. I found some issues that I will solve by next week.
Moreover, my lab partner and I are going to 3D print a new case for the controller. The case will be a bit larger and will be better suited for the controller's components. We also picked up the new fans for the fog screen machine. We tested all six fans and they worked as expected.
