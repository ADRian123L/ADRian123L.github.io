For this week I continued making improvements to the introduction of the research paper. My lab partner and I reviewed the annotations left by our mentor and made the necessary changes. We will start working on the abstract next week.
Moreover, I searched for possible materials for building the fog machine. We decided to use plywood for the structure. I found some options online and will discuss them with my lab partner this week.
