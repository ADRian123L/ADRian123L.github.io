title: Week 6

This week, I worked on the abstract of the research paper. I continued the work that one of the lab partners started last week. I also wrote the first draft of the evaluation section. My lab partner and I will review it next week.
This week, I also worked with my lab partner on designing the new iteration of the fog screen device. We decided to use a different material for the structure. Plywood was not a good option because it was weak and easily absorbed water. We decided to replace it with acrylic. I searched for options on Amazon and found a good one. 
My lab partners and I will continue working on the design of the fog screen device next week. We think that we will be able to finish the design early next week. When we finish the design, we will start building the device. We will laser-cut the parts for the fog screen device and assemble them. We will also print some 3D parts holding the device's components. We designed a shelf-like structure that holds the fog machine, fog screen device, battery, and projector in place.
