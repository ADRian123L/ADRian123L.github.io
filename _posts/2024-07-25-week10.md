This week, I continued working on the ROS package for the Fetch robot. I am learning how to use the Fetch robot with ROS. I am working with my lab partner to create a ROS package that will allow the Fetch robot to control the fog screen device controller. I am also learning how to create a ROS package so that the Fetch robot can navigate to a specific location.
This week, I also started assembling the fog screen device. I am working with my lab partner to assemble the fog screen device. We are assembling the fog screen device in the lab. We are also testing the fog screen device to ensure it works as expected. However, we are waiting for the lab personnel to finish the parts for the fog screen device. We are also waiting for the acrylic to arrive. We will start assembling the fog screen device as soon as the parts and the acrylic arrive.
