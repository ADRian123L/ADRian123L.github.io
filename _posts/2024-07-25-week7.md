title: Week 7

This week, I started working on fixing the fog screen device controller. I made a list of possible sources of error and started working on them. I identified that the Arduino used too much power switching on/off a relay. However, making the changes to fix the controller will take a long time, and I will need to add some extra parts. I will continue working on the controller next week. 
This week, I also discussed the fog screen device with personnel from a lab at the University of South Florida that 3D prints and laser cuts parts. They are willing to help us with the device. I will send them the design of the fog screen device next week, as well as the design of the controller.
