title: Week 8

This week, I continued working on the fog screen device controller. I tested the controller on multiple devices and found that it works better with some devices than others. 
This week, I also talked to a person from a lab at the University of South Florida that 3D print and laser cut parts. They are willing to help us with the fog screen device. I sent them a design for the controller and other parts. The lab personnel started working on the parts, but they found one of the designs unsuitable for 3D printing. They asked us if we wanted to make changes to the design or if we wanted to print anyway and risk the part not working. We decided to make the changes to the design.
