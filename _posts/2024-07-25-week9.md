This week, I continued working on the fog screen device controller. However, I found that the controller worked well on some devices, and since it works well on the Fetch robot, we decided that it was unnecessary to continue working on it. We will use the controller we have now. However, if we encounter any problems with the controller in the future, we will make the changes. 
This week, I also started learning about the Robot Operating System (ROS). I am watching and reading tutorials on how to use ROS. I am also learning how to use the Fetch robot with ROS. I am working on a ROS package meant to connect the Fetch robot with the fog screen device. I am also learning how to create a ROS package so that the Fetch robot can navigate to a specific location.
