## About Me

Hello! My name is Adrian Lozada, and I am a junior studying computer engineering at the University of South Florida (USF). I am passionate about artificial intelligence (AI) models and algorithms that improve human-robot interactions (HRI). My ultimate goal is to integrate robotics into society seamlessly, enhancing our daily lives and improving safety through innovative technology.
I am currently working on a project that aims to develop a fog screen for robots, enabling them to communicate through spatial augmented reality (AR) in environments that do not have conventional projectable surfaces. This summer, I am excited to be part of the CRA-WP DREU program, where I hope to expand my research under the guidance of Dr. Zhao Han and explore new opportunities where technology can meet human needs.

## About My Mentor

Zhao Han is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of South Florida. He leads the Reality, Autonomy, and Robot Experience (RARE) Lab.

Dr. Hanâ€™s research lies broadly in human-robot interaction (HRI), augmented reality (AR), robotics, and AI. He focuses on designing, developing, and evaluating novel robotic systems and interactions, for embodied robots to be more capable and understandable while interacting, collaborating, and teaming up with humans.

To advance this work, Dr. Han takes an interdisciplinary and human-centered approach, developing broad expertise in robot explanations for trust, projector-based and head-worn AR for communication, mobile manipulation for real-world evaluation, cognitive status-informed references, robot failures for robustness, and more.
